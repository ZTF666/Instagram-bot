# ðŸ¤–Z-foll

A small python bot that automates the process of login in to IG via facebook .
Then sends follow requests from the suggestions tab .


## How to use

- **Install**

```python
pip install selenium
```

- **Download**

```
Get your chrome driver from this website : 

```
ðŸ‘‰ [ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/) ðŸ‘ˆ

```

If you're using windows , you may want to put the .exe in the same folder as the script.

If you're using macOs , just move it to /usr/local/bin 

I haven't tested it on linux, but i bet it's the same as macOs ...
